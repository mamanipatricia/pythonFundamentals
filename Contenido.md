### Variables, have to be descriptive


## HOMEWORK:

1. VARIABLES:

- 1. Create two variables, var1 and var2 , both with the same value, it ca be anything you want.
- 2. Create two variables, num1 and num2 , that multiply together to give 16.

Solution:

var1 = "Hello"
var2 = "Hello"

num1 = 4
num2 = 4

2. METHODS:

- 1. Complete the method return_42(), by making it return 42.
- 2. Create a method, which must be called my_method() , which takes two arguments and returns the result of its two arguments multiplied together.

<!-- Complete the method by making sure it returns 42. -->
'''
def return_42():
    pass # 'pass' just means "do nothing". Make sure to delete this!
'''

'''
def return_42():
    return 42

def my_method():
    return arg1 * arg2
'''

# LISTS, TUPLES AND SETS

This coding exercise requires you to complete three steps"
- 1. Create a list, called my_list , with three numbers. Total of the numbers added together should be 100.
- 2. Create a tuple, called my_tuple , with a single value in it.
- 3. MOdify the variable set2 so that set1.intersection(set2) returns {5, 77, 9, 12}

SOLUTION:

1.
my_list = [1, 2, 98]
my_list = [100, 0, 0]
2.
my_tuple = (15) # signify a mathematical operator   X
my_tuple = (15,) _/
my_tuple = 15,  _/
3.
set1 = {14, 5, 9, 31, 12, 77, 67, 8}
set2 = {5}
<!-- SOLUTION -->
set1 = {14, 5, 9, 31, 12, 77, 67, 8}
set2 = {5, 77, 9, 12}
